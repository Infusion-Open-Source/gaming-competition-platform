Stuff todo
==========
- Fix bug in Viewer on staying open for too long, keep system away from loging off
- Make map reader more tolerant to grayscale maps
- Adjust viewer to be started with the game / showing game is in progress and starting playback when is ready
- For tournaments add extraction for a scoreboard (handling scoreboard in viewer would be nice)
- More automated way for infrastructure:
	- adding new player 
	- setting ftp for player
	- sending ftp credentials email
- Review maps for deadtraps like the one Remek found in Infusion Logo map
- Make random map generator player positioning more 'fair' and more 'player too close to obstacle' aware
- if there are more logs than one: it would be nice to know which is being played currently and something like "1/8" (really helpful when playing replays from yesterday) - add info to viewer what it is playing now
- logviewer could be also run in a mode that generates a bitmap(s) as well - than it would be quite easy to merge those bitmap into a movie, and share on yt on whichever other service - this is nice :)
- it would be nice to pick one of the logs to be played again, or choose particular one...

Presentation fixes
==================
- Make a presentation more how-to, just as on a cheet sheets
- Show more proper images from wiever + ascii to more clearly explain relative view of player and world rotation

Starter package changes
=======================
- Create cheat-sheets (PDF):
	- how to test if game is running fine on your pc
	- how to add your bot
	- communication with engine in-a-pill
	- how to use log viewer
- Add some common functions package:
	- char[,] handling, converting, rotating, clonning, cropping
	
Future ideas
============
- rewrite to Mono to run cross platform
- web interface for making submission instead of ftp?
